# Verilog Ethernet VCU118 Example Design

## Introduction

This example design targets the Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board.

The design by default listens to UDP port 1234 at IP address 192.168.1.128 and
will echo back any packets received.  The design will also respond correctly
to ARP requests.  The design also enables the gigabit Ethernet interface for
testing with a QSFP loopback adapter.  

*  FPGA: xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e
*  PHY: 10G BASE-R PHY IP core and internal GTY transceiver

## How to build

Run make to build.  Ensure that the Xilinx Vivado toolchain components are
in PATH.  

## How to test

Run make program to program the VCU118 board with Vivado.  Then run

    netcat -u 192.168.1.128 1234

to open a UDP connection to port 1234.  Any text entered into netcat will be
echoed back after pressing enter.

It is also possible to use hping to test the design by running

    hping 192.168.1.128 -2 -p 1234 -d 1024

Note that the gigabit PHY is also enabled for debugging.  The gigabit port can
be inserted into the 10G data path between the 10G MAC and 10G PHY so that the
10G interface can be tested with a QSFP loopback adapter.  Turn on SW12.1 to
insert the gigabit port into the 10G data path, or off to bypass the gigabit
port.  Turn on SW12.2 to place the port in the TX path or off to place the
port in the RX path.
